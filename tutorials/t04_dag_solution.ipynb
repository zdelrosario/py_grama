The directed edges are labeled with variables; for instance, the `Critical` function takes as inputs `{t, mu, E, h}`, and returns `{sig_cr}`. Then `{sig_cr}` goes both to the `Limit State`, and to the `(Outputs)`. We can also see that the `Limit State` does not *directly* depend on any of the inputs; all inputs are summarized before they enter the limit state function.\n",
